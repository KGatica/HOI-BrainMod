## Abstract

**Background & Motivation**  
Integrating data-driven and modeling approaches is crucial for understanding and proposing mechanistic explanations of complex brain phenomena, such as healthy aging, consciousness, and neurodegeneration. In this context, high-order interactions offer a powerful framework, as they could reveal more informative features than traditional pairwise methods. Whole-brain modeling, in particular, allows us to investigate how functional brain states emerge from the underlying structural substrate and how they are modulated by factors such as neuromodulation changes, connectome disruptions, or external stimulation. Together, these integrative strategies push the boundaries of our mechanistic understanding of brain function and its alterations, for example, in neuromodulation, neurodegeneration, consciousness, and healthy aging.

**What Participants Will Learn**  
Through seminars and hands-on tutorials, participants will learn about advanced biophysical modeling and high-order interactions with applications to functional brain data. Participants will discover how high-order interactions and whole-brain models are transforming our understanding of clinical and cognitive domains, with a particular focus on aging, neurodegeneration, neuromodulation, and consciousness.
